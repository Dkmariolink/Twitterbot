# Twitterbot
Basic twitter bot using Java


How to Run
Download as zip and either open or export to an IDE that allows compiles Java code. I used netbeans. Ensure JDK is included in the library. I included the jar file nesseccary to run the twitter4j framework. All of the "good stuff" is in the lib folder. In the project folder, create a file named "twitter4j.properties". In this properties file, enter your Twitter API key and Access token. Provided a sample in the project. Compile and run in IDE.
